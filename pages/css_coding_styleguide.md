## Preprocessor
The most supported CSS preprocessor at 18F is [Sass/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com). Using this pre-processor means you'll get supported resources such as frameworks, libraries, tutorials and a comprehensive styleguide as support.

That being said, any preprocessor is allowed as long as it's a sound project and has community support.

The recommended way to compile your sass code is through [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) (rather than ruby sass). This allows eliminating the dependency on ruby for projects that don't already require it and is the fastest method of compiling sass.

## Frameworks
18F currently recommends two CSS frameworks. Team members can choose the framework that best meets project and design/dev needs.

1. [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)
2. [PureCSS](http://purecss.io/)


### Rationale
These frameworks were chosen because they are relatively unopinionated about design decisions while still providing the helpers that make frameworks essential to fast and accurate frontend work, ie, solutions for responsive design, grids, and common design patterns. In addition, both frameworks, through modular design and excellent documentation, make it easy for the designer/dev to only use the parts that she/he needs, rather than including a hefty library. Of the two, PureCSS is extremely lightweight, while Bourbon is a Sass mixin library that has extensions for a robust semantic grid ([Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/)), base scaffold ([Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/)) and patterns ([Refills](http://refills.bourbon.io/)).

18F specifically does not recommend using Twitter/Bootstrap for production work because of one, the difficulty in adapting its opinionated styles to bespoke design work and two, its CSS style that places semantic layout instructions directly in HTML classes.


## Format
### Spacing
- Where possible, limit CSS files’ width to 80 characters. See [notes](#format_notes) to see how to configure your text editor to 80 characters.
	- There will be unavoidable exceptions to this rule, such as URLs, or gradient syntax. Don’t worry.
- Use soft-tabs with a two space indent.
- Put one space after : in property declarations.
- Put spaces before { in rule declarations.
- Put a blank line between each selector block.
- To close a selector block, put an unindented closing curly brace on a separate line.
- Each declaration should appear on its own line for more accurate error reporting.
- Do not indent selectors.

```scss
// Good
.rule {
  margin: 3px;
  text-align: center;
}

.another_rule {
  margin: 3px;
}

// Bad
.rule{
    margin:3px;text-align:center;}
```

- Multiple selectors should each be on a single line, with no space after each comma, unless they selector is less than 5 chars.

```scss
// Good
selector1,
selector2,
selector3 {
}

// Good
h1, h2 {
}

// Bad 
selector1, selector2 {
}
```

### Property-Value Pairs
- Put each pair on its own line.
- Indent each pair one level.
- End in a semicolon.

```scss
selector {
  name: value;
  name: value;
}
```

- Spaces should separate values and operators in Sass expressions.

```scss
// Bad
selector {
  font-size: ($font-size+2em);
  font-size: ($font-size +2em);
}

// Good
selector {
  font-size: ($font-size + 2em);
}

```


- Do not use shorthand declarations unless you need to explicitly set all the available values.

```scss
// Bad
margin: inherit 3em;

// Good
margin-bottom: 3em;
margin-top: 3em;

margin: 3em 4em 2em 1em;
```

- Single-quote URLs and string values.

```scss
  background-image: url('/images/kittens.jpg');
  font-family: 'Helvetica', sans-serif;
  font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Helvetica', sans-serif;
```

- Wrap numeric calculations in parentheses.

```scss
// Good
.component {
  width: (100% / 3);
}

// Bad
.component {
  width: 100% / 3;
}
```

- Avoid arbitrary numbers that are repeated, or linked, or dependent on other parts of the code, (aka “magic numbers”).

```scss
// Bad
.component {
  top: 0.327em;
}

// Better
/**
 * 1. Magic number. This value is the lowest I could find to align the top of
 * `.foo` with its parent. Ideally, we should fix it properly.
 */
.component {
  top: 0.327em;
}

// Good
$align_top: 100%;
.component {
  top: $align_top;
}
```

### Sorting
* Follow ordering:
	1. variables
	2. @extend directives
	3. @include directives
	4. properties
- Within properties, you may use alphabetical order or type order—just pick one and keep the whole project consistent.
- Put a new line before nested selectors unless after first selector.
- Put mixin calls with @content after nested selectors.
- Properties should be alphabetical, not grouped by type or length.

```scss
// Bad
.module {

  .module-element {
    color: #fff932;
  }
}

// Good
.module {
  .module-element {
    color: #fff932;
  }
}

// Good
.module {
  $amount = 3;
  @extend .component;
  @include sizing($amount);
  margin-top: $amount * 1em;
  text-align: center;

  .module__ele {
    color: #fff932;
  }

  @include media($sm) {
    margin-top: ($amount + 10em);
  }
}
```

<a name="format_notes"></a>

#### Notes
##### How to set text editors to 80 chars
- Sublime: Add a `rulers` setting with 80 as the value.
	- ```"rulers": [80]```
- Atom: Set the `preferredLineLength` setting to 80.
	- `preferredLineLength: 80`
- Vim: Set two options in your .vimrc to wrap lines at 80 characters.
	- ```set formatoptions+=w```
	- ```set tw=80```


## Units
### Measurements
- Use **rem** units for font sizes with a px fallback.
This can be done with the following mixin:

```scss
@mixin font-size($sizeValue: 1.6) {
  font-size: ($sizeValue * 10) + px;
  font-size: $sizeValue + rem;
}
```

- Set the html font size to 10px to ensure .1 rem unit equals 1px.

```scss
html {
  font-size: 10px;
}
```

- Use **em** units for positioning.
- Use **percentages** when layout components stay relational to each other (e.g. a main content area that takes up 75% of the screen and a sidebar that takes up 25%).

```scss
// Good
.panel-a {
  width: 25%;
}

.panel-b {
  width: 75%;
}
```

- Use **px** units for when a measurement shouldn't change based on user set font size or browser zooming or for when requiring pixel values below 5.

```scss
// Bad
selector {
  border-width: 55px;
}

// Good
selector {
  border-width: 2px;
}
```

- Use unitless values for line-height as this will inherit values from the font-size.
- Use up to 10 decimal places in em units to ensure accuracy.

```scss
// Good
.body_copy {
  @include rem-font-size(1.4);
  // Line height will now be 1.8 of 1.4rem, or 2.5rem.
  line-height: 1.8;
}

// Good
.container {
  height: 12em;
  margin-left: 10.6666666667em;
  width: 82.5%;
}
```

- Do not use a unit with 0.

```scss
// Good
width: 0;
// Bad
width: 0px;
```

- Definitely use a unit for dimensions, margins, borders, padding, and typography.

```scss
// Bad
width: 12;
```


### Colors
- Use **hex** notation first, or then **rgb(a)**, or **hsl(a)**.
- Both three-digit and six-digit hexadecimal notation are acceptable.
- When denoting color using hexadecimal notation, use all lowercase letters.
- When using HSL or RGB notation, always add a single space after a comma and no space between parentheses and content.

```scss
// Good
$light: #fff;
color: $light;
// Good
$primary: #fe9848;
color: $primary;
// Good
$secondary: rgba(255, 100, 255, 0.5);
color: $secondary;
// Bad
color: #FFF;
```

- If you use an rgba rule, include a fallback.

```scss
// Good
.illustration {
  background-color: #eee; // fallback
  background-color: rgba(221, 221, 221, 0.75);
}
```

## Naming
- HTML elements should be in lowercase.

```scss
body, 
div {
```

- Classes should be lowercase.
- Avoid camelcase.
- Name things clearly.
- Write classes semantically. Name its function not its appearance.

```scss
// Bad
// Avoid uppercase
.ClassNAME { }

// Avoid camel case
.commentForm { }

// What is a c1-xr? Use a more explicit name.
.c1-xr { }
```

- Avoid presentation- or location-specific words in names, as this will cause problems when you (invariably) need to change the color/width/feature later.

```scss
// Bad
.blue
.text-gray
.100width-box

// Good
.warning
.primary
.lg-box
```

- Be wary of naming components based on content, as this limits the use of the class.

```scss
// Danger zone
.product_list

// Better
.item_list
```

- Don't abbreviate unless it’s a well-known abbreviation.

```scss
// Bad
.bm-rd

// Good
.block--lg
```

- Use quotes in type pseudo selectors.

```scss
// Good
.top_image[type=’text’] { }
```

- Name CSS components/modules with singular nouns.

```scss
.button { }
```

- Name modifiers and state-based rules with adjectives.

```scss
.is_hovered { }
```

- If your CSS has to interface with other CSS libraries, consider namespacing every class.

```css
.f18-component
```


### Naming Methodologies

When it comes to naming, the most important thing is consistency. The recommended way to do this is using an existing methodology like BEM (which stands for block, element, modifier), or use a custom one that’s clearly defined.

#### BEM

BEM (which stands for block, element, modifier) structures CSS such that every entity is composed of (you guessed it) blocks, elements and modifiers. From [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/)

> The point of BEM is to tell other developers more about what a piece of markup is doing from its name alone. By reading some HTML with some classes in, you can see how – if at all – the chunks are related; something might just be a component, something might be a child, or element, of that component, and something might be a variation or modifier of that component. 

18F generally recommends using a modified BEM methodology outlined in the next subsection. However, you might want to use standard BEM when:
You need a naming scheme that general CSS developers will already be familiar with or an existing naming scheme hasn’t been consistent enough.
When you want to use Javascript to modify the BEM class names dynamically.

#### Suggested custom methodology

The 18F recommendation for a naming methodology is a modified version of BEM. It still uses blocks, sections within blocks and modifiers, but doesn’t use as long a syntax.

```
.accordion
.accordion-item
.accordion-item-selected

.nav_bar
.nav_bar-link
.nav_bar-link-clicked
```

```scss
// block
.inset {
  margin-left: 15%;
  
  // element
  .inset__content {
    padding: 3em;
  }
}

// modifier
.inset--sm {
  margin-left: 10%;

  .inset__content {
    padding: 1em;
  }
}

// modifier
.inset--lg {
  margin-left: 20%;
}

```



### js- Flagged Classes
Don't attach styles to classes with a `js-` flag. These classes are reserved for javascript .

```css
// Bad
.js-people {
  color: #ff0;
}
```

#### Rationale
A `js-` flagged class needs to be highly portable. Adding styles to it breaks that portability.

### test- Flagged Classes
Don't attach styles to classes with a `test-` flag. These classes are reserved for testing hooks such as those used by selenium .

```css
// Bad
.test-people {
  color: #ff0;
}
```

## Inheritance (@include and @extend)
### Mixins
- Use mixins for groups of properties that appear together intentionally and are used multiple times.

```scss
@mixin clearfix {
  &:after {
    content: '';
    display: table;
    clear: both;
  }
}
```

- Use mixins for components to change size.
- Use mixins when something requires parameters.

```scss
@mixin size($width, $height: $width) {
  width: $width;
  height: $height;
}
```

- Do not use mixins for browser prefixes. Use [Autoprefixer]https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

```scss
// Bad
@mixin transform($value) {
  -webkit-transform: $value;
  -moz-transform: $value;
  transform: $value;
}
```


### Extend
Be very careful with using @extend. It's a powerful tool that can have disastrous side-effects. Before using please consider:

- where is my current selector going to be appended?
- am I likely to be causing undesired side-effects?
- how large is the CSS generated by this single extend?

If you're unsure of using @extend, use these rules to not run into trouble:

- Use extend from within a module, not across different modules.
- Use extend on placeholders exclusively, not on actual selectors.
- Make sure the placeholder you extend is present as little as possible in the stylesheet.

You can use mixins in place of selectors. While mixins will copy more code, the difference will often be negligible once the output file has been gzipped.

## Architecture
A site's architecture should be based on its goals and purposes. This means the guidance here should be adapted to different sites and situations.


### Modular/component architecture
When using a modular or component architecture, every page is broken into a series of modular components. There are two sets of these components: ```components``` and ```modules```. The architecture starts out with basic html element rules: html, p, a, form, etc tags that than have components and modules written on top of them. Components are very basic structure such as buttons, blurbs, navs, and positioning structures like insets, island, enclosure. From here, modules are built with these components. This architecture also attempts to keep the specificity trend in an upwards curve as you move down in the file (more on this to come).

- Start with an elements file for all tag rules (a, h1-h5, p, *, html, body).
- Create component files for each structural element, such as buttons, navs, etc. These are mainly class-based and use BEM or another naming scheme.
- Create more specific structure with modules. For instance, if the logo image and text needs very specific treatment, use a module.
	- Build modules from components through mixins, extends and HTML.
	- Modules can have higher specificity, it’s fine to use deeper nesting.
- Have an overrides file or folder comprised of global rules that are meant to override components and modules.
	- These can be generic utilities.
	- A good thing to put here are breakpoint-specific rules, such as hiding something at small breakpoints.

#### File structure
```sh
_elements.scss
_mixins.scss
_typography.scss
_util.scss
_vars.scss
component/_blurb.scss
component/_button.scss
component/_island.scss
component/_sub_nav.scss
module/_logo.scss
module/_progress_bar.scss
lib/bourbon.scss
lib/neat.scss
_overrides.scss
```

- For the `util`, `typography`, `elements`, and `overrides` files, once they grow too large (300 lines or more) in size, split them into their own folder with sub files.

```sh
elements/_all.scss
elements/_p.scss
elements/_h.scss
typography/_body.scss
typography/_links.scss
overrides/_breakpoints.scss
overrides/_util.scss
util/_center.scss
util/_clearfix.scss
```


### Importing
As you likely know, CSS rules that are later in the file override earlier rules. This means Sass imports can be used to control inheritance and specificity.
- Start with base elements.
- Move to single nested classes and utils.
- Move next to more specific classes, often with nesting.
- Move next to overrides, possibly with !important rules.
- Import alphabetically
- Only modify import order for groups of files, not specific files.

```scss
// Bad
@import 'module/logo';
@import 'component/mask';
@import 'component/button'; /* Has to be imported after "mask" */

// Good
@import 'component/button';
@import 'component/mask';
@import 'module/logo';
```

## Specificity
- IDs should be reserved for JavaScript. Don’t use IDs for styles.

```scss
// Bad
#component { }

// Good
.component { }
```

- Don't nest more than 3 layers deep.
- Do not fix problems with ```!important```. Use ```!important``` purposefully.

```scss
// Bad
.component {
  width: 37.4% !important;
}

// Good
.hidden {
  display: none !important
}
```

- Keep specificity low and trend upwards in specificity as you move further down file. See Specificity graph.
- Don't use unnecessary tag selectors.

```scss
// Bad
p.body_text { }

// Good
.body_text
```

- If you have to hack specificity, use a safe hack: the multi class.

```scss
// multi-class hack
.component.component { }
```

### Specificity graph
An easy rule to use when dealing with specificity is to start from a low specificity and curve to higher specificity as you move towards the bottom of the output file. Since CSS rules get replaced by rules further down in the file, you'll override rules in an expected way.

There’s a tool that can graph your files’ specificity, [CSS specificity graph](http://jonassebastianohlsson.com/specificity-graph/). Run your final output file through this tool and strive for a curve trending upwards.

#### Resources
* [CSS specificity graph](http://jonassebastianohlsson.com/specificity-graph/)
* [Explanation](http://csswizardry.com/2014/10/the-specificity-graph/)


### Rationale
With specificity comes great responsibility. Broad selectors allow us to be efficient, yet can have adverse consequences if not tested. Location-specific selectors can save us time, but will quickly lead to a cluttered stylesheet. Exercise your best judgement to create selectors that find the right balance between contributing to the overall style and layout of the DOM.

When modifying an existing element for a specific use, try to use specific class names. Instead of `.listings-layout.bigger` use rules like `.listings-layout.listings-bigger`. Think about ack/grepping your code in the future.

Use lowercase and separate words with hyphens when naming selectors. Avoid camelcase and underscores. Use human-readable selectors that describe what element(s) they style.

Attribute selectors should use double quotes around values. Refrain from using over-qualified selectors; `div.container` can simply be stated as `.container`.

IDs should be reserved for JavaScript. Unless you have a very good reason, all CSS should be attached to classes rather than IDs. When in doubt, use a class name. This prevents target confusion and allows CSS devs and JS devs to co-exist in the same code in peace. If you must use an id selector (`#id`) make sure that you have no more than one in your rule declaration.



## Variables
- Create new variables in the following circumstances:
	- the value is repeated twice;
	- the value is likely to be updated at least once;
	- all occurrences of the value are tied to the variable (i.e. not by coincidence).
- When building scss that will be used across multiple projects use the `!default` flag to allow overriding.

```scss
$baseline: 1em !default;
```

- The `!global` flag should only be used when overriding a global variable from a local scope.
- Variables across the whole scss codebase should be placed in their own file.
- When declaring color variables, don't base the name on the color content.

```scss
// Bad
$light_blue: #18f;
$dark_green: #383;

// Good
$primary: #18f;
$secondary: #383;
$neutral: #ccc;
```

- Be careful when naming variables based on their context.

```scss
// Bad
$background_color
```

- Don't use the value of dimensional variables in the variable name.

```scss
// Bad
$width_100: 100em;

// Good
$width_lg: 100em;
```

- Name all used z-indexes with a variable.
- Have a z-index variable for each z-index used, and a separate variable, possibly aliased for where the z-index is used.

```scss
$z_index-neg_1: -100;
$z_index-neg_2: -200;
$z_index-1: 100;

$z_index-hide: $z_index-neg_2;
$z_index-bg: $z_index-neg_1;
$z_index-show: $z_index-1;
```

## Responsive Design & Breakpoints
- Set variables for breakpoints at the top of your stylesheet. This functionality is built into Bourbon.

```scss
$sm: new-breakpoint(min-width 0 max-width 40em $sm_cols);
```

- Use variables to set the queries throughout so they are easy to adapt if necessary.
- Place media queries nearest to the class they are affecting.
- Rather than focusing on devices when deciding where to put breakpoints, focus on content.

```scss
$iphone: new-breakpoint(min-width 0 max-width 640px 6);
$small: new-breakpoint(min-width 0 max-width 40em 6);
```

- Name breakpoint variables relative to each other, not based on devices.

```scss
// Bad
$mobile
// Good
$small
```

## Documentation
- Be intentional when you use `//` (silent comments) versus `/* */` (which are preserved in the CSS output). When in doubt, use `//`.


### KSS
Use KSS for documentation. More information on KSS can be found on the
[official site](http://warpspire.com/kss/).

#### Example

```scss
// Button
//
// Various buttons on the site.
//
// Markup
// <a class="button {{ modifier_class }}">
//  <span class="button__text">Link</span
// </a>
//
// .button-modified - A button with a different style.
//
//
// Styleguide component.button
.button { ...
.button-modified { ...
```

#### Rationale
KSS is the most common CSS documentation method to date. While it’s not perfect,
the generated documentation can be modified through templates.
