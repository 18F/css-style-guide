# Preprocessors

The most supported CSS preprocessor at 18F is [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
(SCSS). Using this pre-processor means you'll get supported resources such as
frameworks, libraries, tutorials, and a comprehensive styleguide as support.

_That being said, any preprocessor is allowed as long as it's a sound project
and has community support._

The recommended way to compile your Sass code is through
[node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass), rather than Ruby Sass.
This allows eliminating the Ruby dependency for projects that don't already
require it and is the fastest method of compiling Sass.
