Welcome to the 18F Front-End Guide! This is where we keep all of our
guidelines for front-end design and development.

## Why this guide?

18F strives for a level of consistency across projects and code bases.
This guide serves as a canonical reference for guidelines that the
Front-End Guild has researched internally and decided to elevate as
organizational best practices. It's a good starting point for new 18F
developers and designers, as well as anyone seeking to know more about
how and why we build the way we do.

### What's not in this guide

Because front-end work touches so many different realms, this guide links
out heavily to other work that deals with related topics. Some resources of note:

- [18F's guide to best practices for building software](https://github.com/18F/development-guide)
- [18F's project launch, security and ATO guidelines](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/)
- [TTS' accessibility best practice guidelines for front-end developers](https://accessibility.digital.gov/front-end/getting-started/) (link also guides for designers, PMs, and other teammates)

## Front-end design vs. front-end development

Originally, 18F hired for two distinct varieties of front-end work: design and
development. 18F no longer separates the two to diminish administrative
repetition, rather, all front-end work is now called front-end development.

There are subtle but significant differences between front-end design
and development, however. The Front-End Guild did a series of exercises
to determine the fundamental differences between the roles at 18F.
Using [some of our own research methods](https://methods.18f.gov), the
Front-End Guild came up with the following recommendations on knowing the
difference between the two disciplines:

**Front-end designers** design, write, and implement the
presentational code base for websites and applications. They should
have a clear understanding of design fundamentals and systems, such
as interface style guides, responsive design, grid systems, front-end
frameworks, and accessibility best practices. Front-end designers
should feel comfortable creating and implementing design systems
using semantic HTML5, CSS/Sass and be able to assist in debugging
this aspect of the code base.

**Front-end developers** architect, write, and implement the
functional code base for websites and applications. They should have
a clear understanding of client-side render and response, such as
HTTP methods, API consumption, the browser loading/rendering
pipeline, and accessibility best practices. Front-end developers
should feel comfortable developing and implementing client-side
interactions and frameworks using semantic HTML5 and JavaScript, and
should be able to help with debugging, testing, and performance
optimization of the code base.
