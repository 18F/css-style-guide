# Front page user interview discussion guide 

## Intro

Thanks for taking the time to meet with us today. We’re talking to you because you have in the past or are currently working on some aspect of front end development on an 18f project. We’ll be asking you various questions about your front end development experience. We’ll be using this information to gain insight on how we can best help the 18f delivery team on front end as a whole.

I wanted to stress that we are not testing or judging you. We really want to figure out where your pain points are so we can find ways to help.

I also wanted to say that this interview is confidential. Michelle and I will have access to the notes we take during this interview. For anything we share with the team, we won’t attach your identity to the notes. We will also make our best effort at hiding any information that could identify you, such as project names, etc.

If this is all OK, we can begin.
