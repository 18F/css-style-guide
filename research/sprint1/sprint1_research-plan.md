# Initial frontend guild team needs research plan


## Background

18F team members have asked for various frontend resources.

- Specifically asked for a frontend “style guide”. We think this is meant as a more “frameworky” guide where it includes CSS components and how to use them.
- There’re developers across 18F that are working on frontend code but are unfamiliar with some of it.
- There are teams that are unsure how to do testing on the frontend.
- There are some teams that have questions about how best to set up the architecture for their CSS. (Struggling with file structure. General organizational problems.)
- Designers feel like they’d like to know better what to deliver to frontend developers. (Curious about how picky they should be about getting designs 100% correct. Are unsure of what to design as often things aren’t MVP.)
- Developers have asked in the #frontend channel about which CSS framework they should use for different use cases.
- Developers have asked about font licensing and best practices on including fonts on a site.


## Objectives

* Understand how the frontend guild will provide the most value to the 18f team.
* Understand what frontend resources the 18F team needs, such as frontend.frameworks, testing frameworks, frontend guides, coding (JS, CSS) style guides.
* Understand if the guild should primarily serve to consult the 18F team or should provide code or written resources.


## Methods
* 30 min interviews with 18F-ers who consider themselves frontend developers
* Notes, no recording
* Remote
