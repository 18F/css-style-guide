### Original suggestions for guild

These are notes for the record from our first meeting as a guild to brainstorm what we might want to be. Of the next steps listed, we chose to focus on initial research first. This was recently completed and analysis will be in this space soon!

- Outcomes document 
- Hiring guide/tips
- Should there be a separate process that melds the dev/design processes
- Example questions and answers

#### Research
- Style guide/best practices
- coding conventions
- css frameworks and use
- target users? maybe non-frontend dev focused?
- Style guide/testing 

#### Frontend security
- testing - unit and integration

#### Next Steps
- Hiring guide
- survey team on needs 
- Hub page?
- circle up in 4-6 weeks?

#### Ideas
- frameworks -- eval, suggested use. Draft here .
- starter pages - blank templates? (idea from Russ)
