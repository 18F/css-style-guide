* [Bosonic] is both a framework for creating web components and a collection
  of ready-to-use components based on the [webcomponents.js] suite of
  polyfills.
* [Polymer] is Google's web component collection and framework built on the
  [webcomponents.js] polyfill suite. It provides lots of advanced features
  useful for building applications, such as two-way data binding.
* [x-tag] is a Mozilla-initiated, and now Microsoft-maintained, tool for
  easily creating [custom elements](#custom-elements). It's built on the [v1
  spec][custom elements v1], so it requires a [polyfill](#custom-element-polyfills)
  for most browsers, but it's dramatically slimmer (5K gzipped) than Bosonic
  and Polymer.
