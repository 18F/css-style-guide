The front end guild did a series of exercises to determine the fundamental differences between the fron end design and front end developer roles at 18F. Using [some of our own research methods](https://methods.18f.gov), the front end guild came up with the following recommendations on knowing the difference between the two disciplines:

**Front end designers** design, write and implement the presentational code base for websites and applications. They should have a clear understanding of design fundamentals and systems, such as interface style guides, responsive design, grid systems and front end frameworks. Front end designers should feel comfortable creating and implementing design systems using semantic HTML5, CSS/Sass and be able to assist in debugging this aspect of the code base.

**Front end developers** architect, write and implement the funcational code base for websites and applications. They should have a clear understanding of client-side render and response, such as HTTP methods, API consumption and the browser loading/rendering pipeline. Front end developers should feel comfortable developing and implementing client-side interactions and frameworks using semantics HTML5, JavaScript and be able to assist in debugging, testing and performance optimization of the code base.
